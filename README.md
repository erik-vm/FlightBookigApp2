# FlightBookingApp2
 Bit more complex then previous version. Created beacuse of hibernate learning purposes. 

When you run the MainMenu class, the menu on console will display. From there you can choose role, admin or client. Or you can create client account. When you choose admin and there is no admind registerd, it will start creating admin account for you. Same goes for client option. When there is account registerd, then admin needs to insert its username and password, client need to isnert email and password. I implemented some restrictions for setting up username, password, name etc. 
Admin can almost to everything, insert new countries, cities, planes and so on. Exept it cant book a flight. Thats for client. Client can browse flights (in app I named them trips for some reason...) with different conditions and book flight by entering trip id. When flight is booked, the invoice will be automaticlly created tied to client. Client can see its invoices and client also needs depit card with enough funds on it. Funds can be added just by entering the amount in clients menu under debit card option. I wish it was that eazy in real world :D

Anyways it was great challange for me to create this from scratch and I'm almost happy with it. It was done just for my personal fun, to learn bit more how to use hibernate and get better understanding about programming in general.
